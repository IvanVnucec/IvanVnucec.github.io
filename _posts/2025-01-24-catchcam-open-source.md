I'm thrilled to announce that I've open-sourced the software for the Catchcam Speed Camera Detector. You can now find it on GitHub at [github.com/IvanVnucec/catchcam](https://github.com/IvanVnucec/catchcam).

## Why Open Source?

I decided to open source this project because I believe in fostering a open source community. By making this software freely available, I aim to:

- Encourage Improvements: I hope that developers from around the world will contribute to enhancing the functionality of Catchcam.
- Spread Awareness: More people can now benefit from knowing where speed cameras are located, potentially leading to safer driving habits and fewer violations.

## Contributing

I welcome anyone interested to contribute to this project. Whether you're a developer looking to add new features, or someone with ideas on how we can make Catchcam even more user-friendly, your contributions are invaluable. Here's how you can get involved:

- Fork the [Repository](https://github.com/IvanVnucec/catchcam) on GitHub.
- Submit Pull Requests with your improvements or fixes.
- Open Issues for bugs or feature requests.
- Spread the Word: Let others know about this open-source initiative and its potential to improve road safety.

Thank you for your interest and support!

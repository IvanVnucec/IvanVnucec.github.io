I'm starting a new project called Catchcam - a plug and play speed camera detector that works completely offline. It's similar to Waze or Radarbot, but with total privacy in mind - nobody tracks where you are, and no internet needed. Just plug it into your vehicle USB socket and start driving.
It features:

- Built-in speaker and LED for alerts
- Already packed with 66,000+ known speed camera positions, with more coming soon
- Easy updates - just plug into your PC and drag-and-drop latest software

I'll keep you updated on the progress! Stay tuned.

Hello! My name is Ivan Vnučec and I'm an embedded software engineer based in Zagreb, Croatia. I have a passion for building innovative hardware and software solutions, and I love working on side projects.

By day, I work as an embedded engineer, designing and developing devices low power Bluetooth devices. In my free time, I love to work on a projects such as:

- [Attitude Determination and Control System](https://github.com/IvanVnucec/cubesat-adcs) for a Faculty CubeSat,
- Custom [Cortex-M RTOS](https://github.com/IvanVnucec/RTOS_Cortex-M3) written from scratch,
- Simple web pages that I use every that like:
  - [Kajkavski rječnik](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/kajkavski-rjecnik/),
  - [biblija365](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/biblija365/),
  - [year-progress](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/year-progress/),
  - [Neradni dani u Hrvatskoj](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/neradni-dani-u-hr/),
  - [Pretvori Eure u Kune](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/pretvori-eure-u-kune/),
  - [Izlazak i zalazak Sunca u Zagrebu](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/zagreb-izlazak-i-zalazak-sunca/),
  - [Otkrijte koliko knjiga ste mogli pročitati do sada](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/koliko-knjiga-sam-mogao-procitati-do-sada/) and many more.

My latest project - [Catchcam](https://ivanvnucec.github.io/tags/#catchcam), is an offline speed camera detector that respects your privacy. Unlike apps that track your location in the cloud, Catchcam operates entirely offline, using a built-in database of speed camera locations to alert you without any internet connection or personal data collection. Just plug it into your vehicle's USB-C port, and you're ready to go.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:vnucec.ivan@gmail.com) if you'd like to learn more about my work or collaborate on a project. I'd be happy to chat!
